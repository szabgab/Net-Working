Net::Worker - to find out why the network does not work



* Map the network to the Internet
  Given several base-line server eg google.com facebook.com etc, find
  the major breaking points till the internet such as the local router.
  Maybe there are several common hops.
  Allow the user to say which are the spcific hosts/IPs on the way and even let them
   give names to each one.

* Allow the user to have several "profiles" or "locations" where the computer he is
  using might be located.
  e.g. 'home', 'main-office', 'coffee-shop on the corner'
  For each such profile have a "Map to the Internet"


* map the network connection to a given server from a given profile
   Give a hostname or IP address
  For example I might have a server in the 'main-office' which is only mapped in that profile.

* Check what is reachable in the current profile.

* Recognize profiles automatically?
